# ðŸŽ¯ **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

## The Problem
Render is using the wrong start command: `gunicorn your_application.wsgi` instead of `gunicorn app:app`

## The Solution (Do This Now!)

### **Step 1: Fix in Render Dashboard**
1. Go to your Render service dashboard
2. Click **"Settings"** tab  
3. Find **"Start Command"** field
4. **CLEAR** the current wrong command
5. **TYPE EXACTLY**: `gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
6. Click **"Save Changes"**

### **Step 2: Trigger Redeploy**
1. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button
2. Or push a small change to trigger auto-deploy:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Step 3: Monitor Build**
Watch the build logs. You should see:
```
Starting Disease Monitoring Portal...
[INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.2.0
[INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:10000
```

### **Step 4: Test**
```bash
curl https://your-app-url.onrender.com/health
```

## Alternative: Use Start Script
If manual entry doesn't work, set Start Command to: `./start.sh`
