### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd new-model
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   This will create the SQLite database and populate it with sample data.

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the portal**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## üöÄ Usage

### Registering a Disease Case

1. Navigate to the "Register Disease" page
2. Fill in the disease information:
   - Disease type (Dengue, Malaria, COVID-19, etc.)
   - Patient age
   - Complete address
   - Date of occurrence
   - Additional information (optional)
3. Submit the form
4. The system will automatically geocode the address and generate risk predictions

### Viewing Risk Predictions

1. After registering a case, you'll be redirected to the risk prediction page
2. View the interactive map showing risk zones
3. Review recommended actions for disease control teams
4. Access emergency contact information

### Dashboard Analytics

1. Navigate to the Dashboard
2. View disease statistics and trends
3. Monitor active alerts and high-risk areas
4. Export reports and data

### API Usage

The system provides RESTful API endpoints:

- `GET /api/entries` - Retrieve all disease entries
- `GET /api/risk-map/<lat>/<lng>/<disease>` - Get risk predictions for a location

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Model

### Algorithm
The system uses a **Random Forest Regressor** for risk prediction, which:
- Analyzes historical disease data
- Considers multiple factors: location, time, disease type, demographics
- Generates risk scores for different areas
- Updates predictions as new data is added

### Features Used
- **Geospatial**: Latitude, longitude, population density proxy
- **Temporal**: Month, day of year, seasonal patterns
- **Demographic**: Patient age
- **Disease-specific**: Encoded disease type with risk indices

### Risk Scoring
Each disease has a base risk index:
- COVID-19: 0.90
- Dengue: 0.85
- Malaria: 0.80
- Chikungunya: 0.75
- Tuberculosis: 0.70
- Typhoid: 0.65
- Hepatitis A: 0.60
- Influenza: 0.55
- Other: 0.50

Risk scores are modified by:
- **Seasonal factors**: Higher risk during monsoon for vector-borne diseases
- **Age factors**: Increased risk for children (<10) and elderly (>60)
- **Spatial clustering**: Areas with previous cases have higher risk

## üìä Database Schema

### DiseaseEntry
- `id`: Primary key
- `disease_name`: Type of disease
- `patient_age`: Age of the patient
- `address`: Complete address
- `latitude`, `longitude`: Geocoded coordinates
- `occurrence_date`: When the case occurred
- `created_at`: When the entry was created
- `additional_info`: Optional additional details

### RiskPrediction
- `id`: Primary key
- `disease_entry_id`: Foreign key to DiseaseEntry
- `predicted_lat`, `predicted_lng`: Predicted risk location
- `risk_score`: Calculated risk score (0-1)
- `risk_radius`: Radius of risk area in meters
- `prediction_date`: When prediction was made

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key for session management
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string (optional)
- `DEBUG`: Enable debug mode (default: True)

### Customization
- **Disease Types**: Modify the disease list in `app.py`
- **Risk Indices**: Update disease risk scores in `database_models.py`

## üß™ Sample Data

The system includes sample data generation with:
- 200 disease entries across major Indian cities
- Multiple disease types with realistic distribution
- Temporal spread over 2 years
