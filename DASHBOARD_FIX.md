# ✅ **DASHBOARD ERROR FIXED!**

## 🐛 **Issue Identified and Resolved:**

### **Problem**: 
Dashboard was throwing "too many values to unpack (expected 2)" error

### **Root Cause**: 
Template was expecting `disease_counts` to be iterable as tuples `(disease, count)`, but Python was passing it as a dictionary.

### **Solution**: 
Updated dashboard route to convert dictionary to items:
```python
disease_counts=disease_counts.items() if disease_counts else []
```

### **Template Usage**: 
```html
{% for disease, count in disease_counts %}
    <span>{{ disease }}</span>
    <span class="badge">{{ count }}</span>
{% endfor %}
```
