<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

This is a Disease Monitoring and Prediction Portal project that combines:

1. **Web Development**: Flask-based web application with forms for disease registration
2. **Machine Learning**: Predictive models for risk area identification using scikit-learn
3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Location-based risk assessment using geopy and folium
4. **Data Management**: SQLite database for storing disease entries with temporal and spatial data

## Key Components:
- Disease entry registration with address geocoding
- Risk prediction model training on historical data
- Risk area visualization and mapping
- RESTful API endpoints for data access
- Responsive web interface for disease control teams

## Technology Stack:
- Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy, scikit-learn
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- Mapping: Folium, Leaflet
- Database: SQLite
- ML Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- Geospatial: geopy, folium

When generating code, focus on:
- Proper error handling and validation
- Secure data handling practices
- Efficient geospatial calculations
- Scalable ML model architecture
- User-friendly interface design
