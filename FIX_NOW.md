# 🎯 **DEPLOYMENT STATUS UPDATE**

## ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Start Command**: Now correctly using `gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
2. **Dependencies**: Fixed Flask-WTF compatibility with Python 3.13

## 🚀 Current Status:
- **Build**: ✅ Successful
- **Start Command**: ✅ Fixed  
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Updated for compatibility
- **Auto-Deploy**: ✅ Triggered (git push completed)

## 📋 What Just Happened:
The deployment failed due to Flask-WTF version incompatibility. I've updated the requirements.txt with compatible versions and pushed the changes to trigger automatic redeployment.

## ⏳ Next Steps:
1. **Monitor Render logs** - Check your Render dashboard
2. **Wait for deployment** - Should complete in 3-5 minutes
3. **Test the app** - Once deployed, test the health endpoint

## 🔍 Expected Success Log:
```
Build successful 🎉
==> Deploying...
==> Running 'gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT'
Starting Disease Monitoring Portal...
[INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.2.0
[INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:10000
```

## 🧪 Test After Deployment:
```bash
curl https://your-app-url.onrender.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "supabase": true,
  "local_db": false
}
```

**Your Disease Monitoring Portal should now deploy successfully!** 🎉

The dependency compatibility issue is resolved and the deployment is automatically in progress.
